## Description
Project created as part of the Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree.

## Project Instructions
In this project, a static webpage that lacks accessibility is given to be converted into a mobile-ready web application. The design must be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. It will also be added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for the users.

## Run the Application

In order to run the application you can:

* Direct open live Demo: https://moonfallmaple.github.io/restaurant-review/

**Or run it on your computer**
* Download as .zip file
* Clone or fork this project:

    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/moonfallmaple/restaurant-review.git
    ```
* After that run simple http server locally:

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

* For **Non**-Windows user input:

    Python 2.x
    ```
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
    ```

    Python 3.x
    ```
    python3 -m http.server 8000 
    ```

* For Windows user input 
    ```
    python -m http.server 8000 
    ```

* If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
